Live Siswa is an application that allows users to manage student information. It allows users to add, edit, delete and save student data to a CSV file.

To use the application, the user must first open the application and select the "Add Siswa" option. This will bring up a form that the user can fill out with the student's information, including their name, age, and class. Once the form is completed, the user can select the "Save" button to add the student to the CSV file.

The user can also edit existing student information by selecting the "Edit" option and selecting the student they want to edit from the list. This will bring up the same form as the "Add Siswa" option, allowing the user to make changes to the student's information. Once the changes are made, the user can select the "Save" button to update the student's information in the CSV file.

To delete a student from the CSV file, the user can select the "Delete" option and select the student they want to delete from the list. The user will then be prompted to confirm the deletion before the student is removed from the CSV file.

Live Siswa is a useful tool for teachers and school administrators to manage student information and keep track of their progress. It allows for easy and convenient access to student data, making it easier to keep track of student performance and make informed decisions about their education.
